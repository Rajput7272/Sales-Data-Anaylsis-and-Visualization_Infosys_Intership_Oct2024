# Data Operations, Processing, and Visualization

## Data Operations

**Use Case**: Learning how to perform arithmetic & modulus operations. These operations are widely used in scientific computing to support arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions for data structure manipulation.

- **Library Used**: NumPy

**Codes Executed**:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Euclidean Distance
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
5. K-Means Algorithm
6. Naive Bayes Algorithm
7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Data Processing

**Use Case**: Manipulating, transforming, and analyzing data.

- **Library Used**: Pandas

**Codes Executed**:
1. Reading a file (CSV, XLS, etc.)
2. Extracting column headings
3. Updating existing column names
4. Data cleaning

## Data Visualization

**Use Case**: Visualizing data for better understanding and presentation.

- **Library Used**: Matplotlib

**Codes Executed**:
1. Simple Line Plot
2. Scatter Plot
3. Bar Plot
4. Histogram
5. Pie Chart
6. Combination of Line and Bar Plot
7. Customization of Line Styles
8. Saving a Plot
9. Logarithmic Scale
10. Plotting with Annotations (presentation-friendly)
